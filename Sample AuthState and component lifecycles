    /*Note: When Using Blazor server is always renders the components then send it to client
          so you can use OnInitialized

          What is the use of OnInitialized?

          Purpose:
            Used for one-time initialization logic.
            Runs after the component is created but before parameters are set.

          Characteristics:
            Runs only once per instance of a component.
            Good for initial data loading or setup that doesn't depend on parameters.

        var authState = await AuthenticationStateProvider.GetAuthenticationStateAsync();

    /*Note: When Using Blazor server Prerendering is always enabled so you can use OnAfterRender
            to components

      What is the use of OnAfterRender?

      Purpose:
        Runs after the component has finished rendering.
        Used for interacting with the DOM or performing actions that require the component to be fully rendered.

      Characteristics:

        Runs after every render cycle (can run multiple times).
        Has a boolean parameter indicating if this is the first render.
        Good for JavaScript interop or measurements that require rendered DOM.

    /* Note: There is also a OnParametersSet method
     
      What is the use of OnParametersSet?

      Purpose:
        Runs after parameters have been set or changed.
        Used when you need to perform an action based on parameter values.

      Characteristics:
        Runs every time a parameter value changes.
        Good for reacting to changes in input parameters.
